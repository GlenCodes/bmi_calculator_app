# BMI Calculator

A Flutter based project (which uses dart).

This app was an exercise in creating a BMI calculator, a class course from the good folks at London App Brewery.
Specific focus was on the layout, being able to get very granular with customising some of the components/widgets in terms of style, colour, font etc

There was also a focus on how to create a screen transition where the final results are displayed after the age, height, weight etc are given on the first screen.
